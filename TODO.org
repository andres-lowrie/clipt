* TODO Build AST [0%]
- [-] Lexer
- [ ] Parse into AST
- [ ] create some poc interpreter that can execute stuff
* TODO Executor
It should take an AST and build an execution plan
* Features
** Read environment variables
** isolate each test
** allow for environment variable setting for each test
** have a $WORKSPACE,  $CODEBASE that tell the cases where they are
* Questions
** Do we need whitespace?
      a command, which will be tokenized into an Identier (perhaps we need some pass on the AST to check commands?), requires the spaces in order to execute correctly
